# git-init

Git Init is my first program, where I learn the ropes of GitHub as assigned to me in my CSCI 1000 class. It's been difficult doing this because there are a million different platforms I could be using to update this repository.

You should be able to open these files in VSCode and anything else, but this program really doesn't have a use yet. Enjoy!
